# GifTastic
The GifTastic application uses an array of cartoon characters and creates buttons for each item in that array.

The user may enter a new cartoon character name and add that character to the list.

Clicking the button for the corresponding character will use the Giphy API to retrieve 10 gif images and display them for the user, along with the gif's rating.

Clicking a gif image will toggle that gifs animation on and off.
